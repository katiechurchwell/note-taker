## User Story
AS A small business owner

I WANT to be able to write and save notes

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I click on the Save icon

THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column

THEN that note appears in the right-hand column

WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page

THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text in the right-hand column
